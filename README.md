# Effect of Organic Manure and Inorganic Fertilizer on Tomato Production

## Overview
This repository documents an undergraduate thesis submitted to the 
Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Department of 
Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, in September 2023.

The study evaluated the effects of organic manure (poultry manure), inorganic 
fertilizer (NPK 20-10-10), and their combination on the growth, yield, and water 
productivity of tomato plants (*Solanum lycopersicum*) under controlled conditions.

## Research Background
Tomato production is a major agricultural activity in Ghana, yet productivity is 
often constrained by declining soil fertility and improper fertilizer use. Farmers 
commonly apply inorganic fertilizers for quick nutrient availability, while organic 
manures are known to improve soil structure and long-term fertility.

This study compares organic, inorganic, and integrated fertilizer treatments to 
identify their effects on tomato growth performance and yield.

## Objectives
- To evaluate the growth rate of tomato plants under different fertilizer treatments
- To determine tomato yield under organic, inorganic, and combined fertilizer applications
- To assess crop water productivity across fertilizer treatments

## Experimental Design
- Experimental design: Randomized Complete Block Design
- Replications: 6
- Treatments:
  - Poultry manure
  - NPK 20-10-10
  - 50% poultry manure + 50% NPK
  - Control (no fertilizer)
- Growth medium: Topsoil in 12L containers
- Study location: Lath house, Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, KNUST

## Data Collected
### Growth Parameters
- Plant height (cm)
- Number of leaves
- Stem girth (cm)

### Yield Parameters
- Number of fruits
- Fruit weight (g)

### Water Use Efficiency
- Crop Water Productivity (kg/m³)

## Methodology
- Tomato seedlings were nursed and transplanted after four weeks
- Fertilizers were applied before transplanting and four weeks after transplanting
- Growth data were collected weekly
- Harvesting occurred between the 10th and 12th week
- Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Mean separation was performed using Least Significant Difference (LSD) at 5% probability

## Tools & Analysis
- Microsoft Excel (data entry, analysis, charts)
- Statistical analysis (ANOVA, LSD)
- Field measurements (vernier caliper, meter rule, weighing scale)

## Key Findings
- Poultry manure produced the highest tomato yield and crop water productivity
- Integrated fertilizer (50% poultry manure + 50% NPK) performed comparably to poultry manure
- NPK fertilizer promoted rapid early growth but lower water productivity
- Control treatment recorded the lowest growth and yield
- Organic manure showed superior long-term growth and yield benefits

## Crop Water Productivity (kg/m³)
| Treatment | CWP |
|---------|-----|
| Poultry manure | 2.72 |
| 50% organic + 50% inorganic | 1.88 |
| NPK | 1.43 |
| Control | 0.22 |

## Conclusions
Poultry manure proved to be the most effective fertilizer treatment for improving 
tomato growth, yield, and water productivity. Integrated use of organic and inorganic 
fertilizers offers a sustainable alternative with strong performance.

## Recommendations
- Farmers in Ghana are encouraged to adopt poultry manure as a primary fertilizer source
- Integrated fertilizer application should be promoted for sustainable tomato production
- Further on-farm studies are recommended to evaluate long-term soil impacts
